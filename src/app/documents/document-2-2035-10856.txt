1.0 Summary
CIBC believes that environmental responsibilities and business objectives are connected, as a healthy and sustainable environment fosters sustainable economic growth. As a financial institution, CIBC recognizes the impact of its activities on the environment and acknowledges the Bank's responsibility to manage environmental issues effectively.
Each CIBC team member¹ is responsible for taking reasonable care to ensure that CIBC's activities are conducted in an environmentally prudent manner that contributes over the long term to CIBC shareholder value. The Corporate Environmental Policy (Policy) describes the principles of prudent environmental management and assigns responsibilities for managing environmental issues.
2.0 Intent
The purpose of this Policy is to set out the key environmental principles and requirements that support CIBC's approach to environmental management. These principles and requirements apply when dealing with environmental matters for both personal (aligned to the CIBC Code of Conduct) or business reasons and are in addition to those found in the CIBC Code of Conduct and other CIBC policies. You must exercise good judgement and be respectful of the environment and your actions must always be governed by the CIBC Code of Conduct and our shared values of Trust, Teamwork and Accountability.
Failure to adhere to this Policy could expose CIBC to financial, credit, legal, regulatory, and reputational risks.
3.0 Audience and Scope
This Policy applies to the activities for all team members of CIBC and, subject to their review and approval where required by applicable law, its wholly-owned subsidiaries2 (collectively "CIBC").
An employee who contravenes any provision of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action up to, and including termination of employment, without notice or pay in lieu of notice, as well as possible civil, criminal, or regulatory action. Such conduct may also affect individual performance assessments and compensation.
A contingent worker who contravenes any provision of this policy may be subject to action by CIBC up to, and including termination of their assignment, without notice, as well as possible civil, criminal or regulatory action.
4.0 Key Requirements of Environmental Management

The Environmental Risk Management group (ERM) is responsible for implementing and maintaining a Corporate Environmental Management program to monitor and oversee adherence to this Policy principles and associated requirements.
The program follows an EMS framework, which sets objectives and targets, monitors progress, and strives for continuous improvement. Detailed program requirements are articulated in standards, procedures, and guidelines governing environmental management. More information on the program can be found in the Related Materials section of this Policy and on CIBC's website: https://www.cibc.com/en/about-cibc/corporateresponsibility/environment.html.

When any review criteria within the supporting standards and procedures are met, the related business or functional group will engage ERM for review and guidance.
